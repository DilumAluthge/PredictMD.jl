## Instructions:
## If you are running this file for the first time and/or if you do not have
## any existing trained models saved on disk, then take the following steps:
##     1. Comment out line 39
##     2. Uncomment line 40
##     3. Comment out lines 42 through 47
##     4. Uncomment lines 48 through 53 and choose appropriate filenames for
##        saving the trained models to file.
##     5. Run the entire file. This will train all of the models, compare their
##        performance, generate plots, and save the trained models to file.
## If you have trained models saved on disk and you would like to load them,
## then take the following steps:
##     1. Uncomment line 39
##     2. Comment out line 40
##     3. Comment out lines 42 through 47
##     4. Uncomment lines 48 through 53 and set the variables to the
##        filenames where the trained models are saved.
##     5. Run the entire file. This will load all of the trained models from
##        file, compare their performance, and generate plots.
